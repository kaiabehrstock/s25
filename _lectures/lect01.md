### Code Clarity
- It is highly encouraged to use explicit parentheses to make your code clearer.
- Keep in mind that the `and` operator has higher precedence than some other logical operators in Python, such as `or`.

### Data Structures: Set vs. List
- **List (`list`)**: Ordered, allows duplicates, supports indexing.
- **Set (`set`)**: Unordered, no duplicates, supports set operations like union or intersection, just as in math.

### Autograder
- Engaging with the lab material and calling our attention to improvements that could be made may result in extra credit at the end of the quarter.
- Think critically about the test cases you write to ensure your code is robust!
- If at least half of the students are affected by an issue, the instructor may consider making an accommodation.
- If your submission has a syntax error, the autograder will give a zero.
- Unlimited submissions are allowed on **Gradescope**

### Testing & Assertions
- It is impossible to prove a program is 100% correct.
- Labs require you to write additional `assert` statement to verify correctness.
- The autograder has more `assert` statements in the backend that will further validate your code.
- On the midterm and final, you will be required to write `assert` statements for a given function.
